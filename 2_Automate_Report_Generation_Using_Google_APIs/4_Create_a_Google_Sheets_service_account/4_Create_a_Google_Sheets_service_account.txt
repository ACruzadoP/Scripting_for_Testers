The 1st thing that the instructor asked us to do is to go to:
https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/dashboard?pli=1&supportedpurview=project

and to create project for testing. In my case, I created "TestProject_for_Python_course". 

Once created, we have to click on "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES"
> Search for "Sheets" and click on "Google Sheets API".
> Click on "ENABLE" and then go back "←"
> Search for "Drive" and click on "Google Drive API"
> Click on "ENABLE" and then go back to "Dashboard" (in Spanish: "API y servicios habilitados")
    but actually, we need to go to "Credentials"
    > Click on "Create credentials"
    > Click on "Service account key"
    > Select "New service account"
        > Give it a name. I went for "ScriptAccount"
        > Click on "Crear y continuar".
                    *at this point, the instructor stated that a role had to be selected (Project > Editor) - however, we didn't get the option. 
        > Select role "Project > Editor"
        > Click on "Continue" and finish the proccess. 


At this point, I had to stop for a couple of reasons:
1. I don't know what or why I'm doing this.
2. A file was supposed to be automatically downloaded but we missed a step apparently. It's important to keep in mind that the UI has be modified and the steps are no longer the same. 

With that said, I'm going to skip this part of the course.

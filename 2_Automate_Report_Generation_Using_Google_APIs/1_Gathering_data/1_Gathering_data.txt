Testing the nesting folders... apparently, when in a folder there's a sub-folder and nothing else, the Explorer of Visual Studio Code doesn't show it. It's shown above the text field but that's it. 
Interesting...



With that said, let's get started. 

In this part of the course we will check how analyzing the data gathered from a Perfomance test. This data is available in a CSV file called "TestTimingData.csv"
    - which is basically the same thing as an Excel file, but with different format. According to wikipedia, CSV stands for "comma-separated values"
    - so file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Long story short: 1 column, several rows. 
We use CSV because python provides us with a tool (that needs to be imported) to work with it. 

As a side note, the script will be called "readInData.py"

In this video, the instructor is giving an introduction about how we could include Google Charts in our python script for automatically generating a presentation chart. 

First, we are asked to head to this website:
https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/basic_load_libs

    the script has to be included in the "head" 


Then, we gotta go to:
https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/datatables_dataviews#arraytodatatable

    we have to copy the 1st example and paste it into a function in the "head", but right after the previous script
    also, keep in mind that the content should be modified for "$labels and $data"


Finally, we gotta go to:
https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/basic_draw_chart

    here we have to copy the 1st part that says "Instantiate and draw our chart" - with little mofidification, we will be able to paste it at the end of the function we created before.
    then, we have to copy the 2nd part and paste it in the "body"

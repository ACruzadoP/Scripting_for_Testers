From now on, we will no longer use "response.json()" as it is. 

Instead, we will assign the json to a variable that will serve as a dictionary - btw, dictionary and json are the same thing. 

"my_json = response.json()"
"for key in my_json.keys():"
"print(key)"

this will print all the keys. If we want the value of a certain key, we will have to go with:

"my_json['name_of_the_key']"

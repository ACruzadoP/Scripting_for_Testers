In this section of the course, we are being provided with lots of information that I don't think I need. However, I found something pretty cool and it was a function to log into a website. 

def login(driver):
	user_name = driver.find_element_by_id('txtUsername')
	pwd = driver.find_element_by_id('txtPassword')

	user_name.send_keys('Admin')
	pwd.send_keys('admin')

	login_button = driver.find_element_by_id('btnLogin').click()



login(driver)



As always, bear in mind that the course is outdated and some functions were deprecated every since. 


also.. for shortcuts we could use something like this:

send_keys(Keys.CONTROL + "a")
= select all*

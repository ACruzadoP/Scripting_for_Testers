As always the website, that the trainer uses for testing, doesn't exist anymore. So let's try to write down everything I learn without the proper practicing...

    - When looking at a component that repeats over a website, you can inspect it and find its type of tag. (e.g., "b")

        b_tags = driver.find_elements("TAG_NAME", 'b')
        price_list = []
        for b in b_tags:
            price_list.append(b.text)

        print (price_list)

In this part of the course, we learn how to identify the different elements on the web to be tested.
- Right click > Inspect > check the html
    - The class or the ID are good parameteres to identify, but they're not always available and/or good indicators.
- We we don't find a good identifier, right click on the HTML tag > Copy > Copy XPath. 

Now we run into the 1st issue. find_element_by_xpath is no longer used. Instead, we gotta use -> 

    driver.find_element("xpath", '')


Apparently, the website used in the Example doesn't work anymore. I used another one and clicked on the Search button. 



Another cool thing to do is to go back in the browser, to the previous site by writting the following:
    driver.back()


Stuff to consider:
    1. If we try clicking a button that's contanied within an "iframe", we gotta switch to it. To do so:

        import time
        time.sleep(1)
        driver.switch_to.frame('...') // being ... the name of the frame


        2. Now that we are switched into the iframe. We can grab one of the links. To do so:

            link_elements = driver.find_elements("TAG_NAME", 'a')
            print(link_elements[0].get_attribute('href'))


        *I don't know if this works as I don't have a website to try it on.

In the last example, I tried with a website (JSONPlaceholder.com) for which we didn't need to enter any credentials. 

We will try now with another one for which we need to pass through an Authentication process... Cool! ^^

However, before doing that, we need to keep in mind that right now I work from the PC and this one doesn't have the same configuration we had before. So let's start with the basic stuff:

"python -m pip install requests"
"cls"
"python"
"import requests"

next, we will add the url where the Authentication seems to be a requirement:

"url = 'https://api.github.com/user'"
"response = requests.get(url)"
"response.json()"

at this point, it's clear that the API is requesting us to pass through the Authentication process.

"response = requests.get(url,auth=('djw-test','password1'))"
"response.json()"

apparently, that user is no longer accessible and I won't enter my credentials for obvious reasons... so I guess we will have to trust that it will work. 
At this point, the instructor says that entering your password in plain text is not a good idea and that it would be better to enter a token instead. 
Then he goes to Github > Personal settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Generate new token
    - checking "user" and everything that belongs to it. 

Once we have copied the token, we have to include it in our script as follow:

"response = requests.get(url,headers={'Authorization':'Bearer 単lkajsdfkjawefkasd単klfjasdf'})
    *being "単lkajsdfkjawefkasd単klfjasdf" the token we just copied. 
"response.json()"

There are other ways of not using your password, but they are a bit more complex it seems.

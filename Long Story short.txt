At the time of completing this course, I had Python 3.10.4 already installed in the PC. However, I decided to install 3.11.1 - as it's always good to use the most updated version of this stuff. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure the latest version is the one working, as "python --version" is still retrieving the older version.

I may need to manually remove the older version from here: 
C:\Users\ACRUZADO\AppData\Local\Programs\Python

As a side note, and before I do anything to the PC I work with, let's prepare my old MacBook so that I can do the courses in both, the laptop that I was provided with by Unit4 and the one I own. 
Step 1 - Repository locally copied. 
Step 2 - Visual Studio Code successfully installed.
Step 3 - Downloaded Python 3.11.1
    *On Mac, I had to use "python3 --version". For some reason, it was Phython3 the one that was installed.
 

 With all already set, let's jump into the course...

Btw! Appartenly, I was unable to do a "git push" from Terminal. I had to do it from Visual Studio Code. I even tried using a token instead of the standalone Password...
let's try again. 
- and... it worked! Somehow, Visual Studio Code did the proper Authentication-related configuration on my behalf. Thanks Code! =)

Topic 1: REST API calls
    - POST: Creating new object
    - PUT: Updating an object
    - DELETE: No need to explain
    - GET: No need to explain

with the following command, the instructor installed a module that will help in working with REST APIs in Python
"python3 -m pip install requests"
then, two additionals commands in order to try with some objects available in the following website: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
"python3"
"import requests"
"url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos'
"response = requests.get(url)"
"print (response.json())"
at this point, the raw JSON should have been retrieved. 

Let's try now by creating a new object and Posting it to the site. 

"jsonPayload = {'albumID':1,'title':'test','url':'nothing.com','thumnailURL':'nothing.com'}"
"response = requests.post(url,json=jsonPayload)"
"response.json()"
at this point, we should have seen that id 5001 was granted as there's now 1 additional item in the photos folder.

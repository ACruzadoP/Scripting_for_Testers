At the time of completing this course, I had Python 3.10.4 already installed in the PC. However, I decided to install 3.11.1 - as it's always good to use the most updated version of this stuff. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure the latest version is the one working, as "python --version" is still retrieving the older version.

I may need to manually remove the older version from here: 
C:\Users\ACRUZADO\AppData\Local\Programs\Python

As a side note, and before I do anything to the PC I work with, let's prepare my old MacBook so that I can do the courses in both, the laptop that I was provided with by Unit4 and the one I own. 
Step 1 - Repository locally copied. 
Step 2 - Visual Studio Code successfully installed.
Step 3 - Downloaded Python 3.11.1
    *On Mac, I had to use "python3 --version". For some reason, it was Phython3 the one that was installed.
 

 With all already set, let's jump into the course...

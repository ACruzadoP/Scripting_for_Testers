REST API calls
    - POST: Creating new object
    - PUT: Updating an object
    - DELETE: No need to explain
    - GET: No need to explain

with the following command, the instructor installed a module that will help in working with REST APIs in Python
"python3 -m pip install requests"
then, two additionals commands in order to try with some objects available in the following website: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
"python3" // This opens Python. To close it, go with CTRL + Z
"import requests"
"url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos'
"response = requests.get(url)"
"print (response.json())"
at this point, the raw JSON should have been retrieved. 

Let's try now by creating a new object and Posting it to the site. 

"jsonPayload = {'albumID':1,'title':'test','url':'nothing.com','thumnailURL':'nothing.com'}"
"response = requests.post(url,json=jsonPayload)"
"response.json()"
at this point, we should have seen that id 5001 was granted as there's now 1 additional item in the photos folder.

Let's try now by using PUT in order to modify an existing item

"url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/100'"
"response = requests.put(url,json=jsonPayload)"
"response.json()"

Last but now least, let's try the DELETE

"response = requests.delete(url)"
"response.json()"
